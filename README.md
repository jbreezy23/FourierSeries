# FourierSeries

A visualization representation of a square wave using the Fourier Series, (4*sin(i*theta))/(i*PI).

The sliders vary the i and theta terms respectively. 
i can be varied from 1 to 41, incrementing by 2 for each slider movement.
Theta is the timestep of the function and thus affects the period of the resultant wave. The second slider controls this variable and varies the timestep from .02 to .36
